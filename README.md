# vue-template

Simple Vue JS template that I use when I start a project, this also works very good if you are going to use Vue in a wordpress theme, It Includes Vuex and Vue-Router.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Compile JS
npm run dev

# Compile Sass
gulp sass:watch
```
# universal-template
